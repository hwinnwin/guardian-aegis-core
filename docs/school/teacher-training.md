# Guardian Teacher Training Module

**15-Minute Awareness Training for Teachers**

**Goal:** Help teachers understand what Guardian is, what it isn't, and how to support students—without accessing alerts or sensitive information.

---

## Your Role with Guardian

**You are a student support professional, not a Guardian operator.**

**What you need to know:**
- What Guardian does (and doesn't do)
- How to respond if a student discloses a concern
- When and how to refer to the school counselor

**What you will NOT do:**
- Receive Guardian alerts
- Access student safety information
- Monitor or investigate threats
- Handle crisis response

**The school counselor is the Guardian point person. You support students and refer concerns.**

## What is Guardian?

**Guardian is "antivirus for online predators"—not student surveillance.**

**Guardian detects:**
- Adult grooming behavior
- Sexual solicitation
- Predatory manipulation
- Dangerous boundary violations

**Guardian does NOT detect:**
- Normal student conversations
- Peer interactions
- Academic activity
- Screen time
- Location
- Social media use (beyond threats)

**Key message: Protection, not surveillance.**

## What Teachers Need to Know

### 1. Guardian is Active

Students in our school have Guardian protection (with parent consent). Some students may mention it or ask questions.

### 2. You Don't Have Access

You will not receive Guardian alerts. You cannot access student safety information. This protects student privacy.

### 3. The Counselor is the Point Person

All Guardian alerts go to [Counselor Name]. They handle assessment, parent notification, and intervention.

### 4. Students May Disclose to You

Even with Guardian, students may tell you directly about concerning interactions. You should know how to respond.

## How to Respond if a Student Discloses

**If a student tells you about a concerning online interaction:**

**Step 1: Listen calmly**
- Don't panic or react with alarm
- Don't interrogate or press for details
- Validate their courage in telling you
- Reassure them they're not in trouble

**What to say:**
```
"Thank you for trusting me with this. You did the right thing by telling me.
You're not in trouble. I'm going to connect you with [Counselor Name] who
can help make sure you're safe."
```

**Step 2: Refer to school counselor immediately**
- Walk student to counselor's office (if available)
- OR contact counselor to arrange immediate meeting
- OR email counselor with "urgent student safety concern"

**Do NOT:**
- Investigate yourself
- Contact the parent directly
- Discuss with other teachers
- Handle it alone

**Step 3: Document briefly**
- Date/time of disclosure
- Brief summary (student's words if possible)
- Referral made to counselor

**Step 4: Follow up with counselor**
- Confirm student connected with counselor
- Ask if there's anything you should do to support student
- Maintain confidentiality

## Student Questions You Might Hear

**"Is Guardian spying on me?"**

**Your response:**
```
"Guardian isn't spying—it's protecting. It only detects when an adult is
trying to harm you. Your normal conversations with friends, your browsing,
and your messages are private. The school doesn't see them unless there's
a safety concern from a dangerous adult."
```

**"Will I get in trouble if Guardian flags something?"**

**Your response:**
```
"No. Guardian is about safety, not punishment. If it detects something
concerning, our counselor will talk with you to make sure you're okay.
You're not in trouble for being targeted by someone dangerous."
```

**"What if it makes a mistake?"**

**Your response:**
```
"If Guardian flags something that isn't actually a threat, our counselor
will assess and dismiss it. No consequences for false alarms. And the
feedback helps make Guardian more accurate."
```

**"Can you see my messages?"**

**Your response:**
```
"No. I don't have access to Guardian alerts or student messages. Only our
school counselor receives alerts, and even they only see summaries, not
full conversations. Your privacy is protected."
```

## Red Flags: When to Refer to Counselor

**If you notice or hear about:**

- Student mentions talking to an "older boyfriend/girlfriend" online
- Student seems secretive about online relationships
- Student receives gifts or money from unknown sources
- Student shows signs of grooming (isolation, secrecy, inappropriate relationships)
- Student discloses sexual content sent or received
- Student mentions meeting someone from online in person
- Student seems scared of online contact
- Student asks about deleting conversations or hiding activity

**Don't investigate. Refer immediately.**

---

## Supporting Students Post-Alert

**If the counselor tells you a student is dealing with a Guardian alert:**

**Do:**
- Maintain normal supportive relationship
- Be available if student wants to talk
- Respect their privacy and dignity
- Follow counselor's guidance on support

**Don't:**
- Ask probing questions about the incident
- Treat them differently or with pity
- Discuss with other staff or students
- Bring it up unless they do

**Remember:** The student may feel shame, fear, or confusion. Your steady, supportive presence helps.

---

## Confidentiality & Privacy

**What you can share:**
- General Guardian information (how it works)
- Referral procedures
- Support resources

**What you cannot share:**
- Individual student alert information
- Specific threats detected
- Family situations related to Guardian
- Any details disclosed by students

**Breach of confidentiality is serious and may violate policy/law.**

---

## Guardian Boundaries

**Guardian is NOT a tool for:**
- Discipline
- Academic monitoring
- Behavior management
- Checking if students did homework
- General "keeping tabs" on students

**If you're asked to use Guardian for these purposes, decline and refer to administration.**

**Guardian's sole purpose: Protect students from adult predators.**

---

## Common Misconceptions

**Myth:** "Guardian monitors everything students do online."
**Truth:** Guardian only detects predatory adult behavior patterns.

**Myth:** "Teachers can see student messages."
**Truth:** Only the school counselor receives summary alerts. No one sees full messages except parents.

**Myth:** "Guardian replaces talking to students."
**Truth:** Guardian is a tool that supports relationships, not replaces them.

**Myth:** "Students who get flagged are in trouble."
**Truth:** Detection means a student may need protection, not punishment.
