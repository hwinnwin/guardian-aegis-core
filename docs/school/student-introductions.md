## Ages 8-11: Simple & Reassuring

**Setting:** Classroom or small group
**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Tone:** Warm, simple, protective

---

### Script for Ages 8-11

**Opening:**

"Hi everyone! I want to tell you about something new at our school that helps keep you safe online. It's called Guardian, and it's kind of like a safety helper for when you're using the internet.

Raise your hand if you use the internet or play games online. (acknowledge responses) Great! The internet is fun and useful, but sometimes there are grown-ups online who try to trick kids or ask them to do unsafe things. Guardian helps protect you from those grown-ups.

**How Guardian works:**

Guardian is like a safety alarm. If a grown-up tries to:
- Ask where you live or go to school
- Tell you to keep secrets from your parents or teachers
- Say things that make you uncomfortable
- Try to meet you in person

... Guardian notices and tells our school counselor, [Name], so they can make sure you're okay.

**What Guardian doesn't do:**

Guardian does NOT watch everything you do. It doesn't see:
- Your messages with friends
- Your games
- Your videos
- Your homework

It only pays attention if a grown-up is trying to trick or hurt you.

**Your privacy:**

Your conversations with your friends are still private. Guardian only cares about keeping you safe from dangerous grown-ups.

**What you should do:**

If anyone online—even if they seem nice—asks you to:
- Keep secrets from your parents
- Send pictures
- Tell them where you live
- Meet them somewhere

Tell a trusted grown-up right away: your parents, me, your teacher, or another adult you trust.

You can also always come talk to me if something online makes you feel weird, scared, or uncomfortable. You won't be in trouble—I just want to make sure you're safe.

**Questions?**

(Allow time for questions. Keep answers simple and reassuring.)

**Closing:**

Remember: Guardian is here to protect you, not watch you. Your job is to have fun, learn, and tell a trusted grown-up if anything feels wrong. We're all here to keep you safe!"

### Q&A for Ages 8-11

**"Can Guardian see my messages with my friends?"**
"No, Guardian doesn't read your messages with friends. It only notices if a grown-up is being unsafe."

**"Will I get in trouble if Guardian finds something?"**
"No! If Guardian notices something, it means we want to make sure you're safe. You won't be in trouble."

**"What if a grown-up is actually nice?"**
"Sometimes grown-ups who want to hurt kids act really nice at first. That's called tricking. If Guardian notices, we'll talk to you to make sure everything is okay."

**"Does my mom/dad know about Guardian?"**
"Yes! We sent a letter to your parents telling them all about Guardian. They know it's helping keep you safe."

## Ages 12-14: Detailed & Educational

**Setting:** Classroom, assembly, or small group
**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Tone:** Respectful, informative, empowering

### Script for Ages 12-14

**Opening:**

"Today I want to talk with you about a new safety system our school is using called Guardian. I know 'safety system' might sound like surveillance or monitoring, so I want to be really clear about what this is and isn't.

**What Guardian is:**

Guardian is software that detects when adults online are trying to harm or manipulate young people. Think of it like antivirus software, but instead of protecting your device from viruses, it protects you from online predators.

**Why we're using it:**

The reality is that there are adults online who specifically target teenagers for grooming, exploitation, or harm. They use specific tactics to build trust, isolate you from support, and manipulate you. Guardian detects these tactics and alerts our counselor so we can make sure you're safe.

This isn't about controlling you or invading your privacy—it's about protecting you from real threats.

**How Guardian actually works:**

Guardian looks for specific behavior patterns that predators use:
- Adults asking for personal information (address, school location, phone number)
- "Don't tell your parents" secrecy requests
- Moving conversations to other platforms where there's less oversight
- Sexual or inappropriate language from adults
- Attempts to plan in-person meetings
- Manipulation tactics like "you're so mature for your age"

Guardian does NOT monitor your normal online activity. It's not reading your group chats with friends, tracking what videos you watch, or monitoring your social media. It's only detecting dangerous adult behavior.

**What happens if Guardian detects something:**

If Guardian detects a concerning pattern, our school counselor gets an alert summary—not your full conversation, just a summary of what pattern was detected. The counselor will:
1. Talk with you privately to make sure you're safe
2. Contact your parents
3. Work with you and your family on next steps

Your parents—not the school—have access to the full evidence. The school can't read your private messages.

**Your privacy:**

I want to be really clear about privacy because I know that's important to you:

- Your messages with friends: Private
- Your browsing: Not monitored
- Your social media: Not accessed (unless a threat is detected)
- Your location: Not tracked
- Your photos/videos: Not accessed

Guardian uses something called a "rolling buffer"—it only looks at recent messages and then automatically deletes them. Nothing is saved unless a threat is detected.

**Why we're being transparent:**

We're telling you directly about Guardian because we believe you deserve to know. This isn't secret. We're not trying to trick you. We want you to understand what's protecting you and why.

**What you can do:**

Even with Guardian, you play the biggest role in your own safety:
- Trust your instincts—if something feels off, it probably is
- Don't share personal information with people you only know online
- Be careful about meeting online contacts in person
- Tell a trusted adult if someone makes you uncomfortable
- Know the signs of grooming and manipulation

You can also report concerns directly to the counselor—you don't have to wait for Guardian to detect something.

**Questions?**

(Allow substantial time for questions. Teenagers will have many. Be honest and respectful.)

**Closing:**

I know this might feel weird or invasive at first. That makes sense. But I want you to know that this is about your safety, not control. Your privacy matters, your autonomy matters, and so does protecting you from people who want to cause harm.

If you have concerns or questions later, come talk to me. This is a conversation, not a lecture."

---

### Q&A for Ages 12-14

**"Isn't this just spying with extra steps?"**

"I hear that concern. The key difference: spying is monitoring everything you do to control you. Guardian only detects specific dangerous behavior from adults. Your normal life—friends, interests, conversations—is private. If this crossed into surveillance, I'd be the first to object."

**"What if I'm talking to someone I actually want to talk to?"**

"Guardian detects manipulation patterns from adults. If you're talking to someone your age or an appropriate adult (like a family friend, teacher, coach), Guardian won't flag it. It's looking for predatory behavior, not normal relationships."

**"Can my parents see everything I do now?"**

"No. Your parents only get access to evidence if Guardian detects a threat. They can't use Guardian to spy on your normal activity. You still have privacy."

**"What if it's wrong and flags something innocent?"**

"False positives can happen. If that occurs, the counselor reviews it, sees it's not actually a threat, dismisses it, and provides feedback to improve accuracy. You don't get in trouble for false positives."

**"What about my rights?"**

"You have the right to privacy, and Guardian is designed to respect that while also protecting your safety. If you feel your rights are being violated, please talk to the counselor or your parents. There's also an opt-out process if your family prefers."

## Ages 15-17: Comprehensive & Agency-Focused

**Setting:** Classroom, assembly, or individual conversations
**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Tone:** Respectful, peer-like, transparent, empowering

---

### Script for Ages 15-17

**Opening:**

"I'm going to talk with you as adults-in-training, because that's what you are. You deserve full transparency about what's happening and why.

Our school is implementing Guardian—an online predator detection system. I know how that sounds. So let me be direct about what this is, what it isn't, and why you should care.

**The threat is real:**

Adults targeting teenagers online for exploitation is not rare. It happens. You may have experienced it yourself or know someone who has. Predators use sophisticated manipulation tactics—grooming, isolation, love bombing, boundary erosion. They're practiced at it.

Guardian exists to detect those tactics and intervene before harm occurs.

**How Guardian actually works (technical level):**

Guardian uses a multi-layer detection system:
1. **Pattern matching**: Known predatory language and behavior patterns
2. **Local ML model**: AI running on your device that detects manipulation tactics
3. **Behavioral analysis**: Escalation patterns, context shifts, boundary testing

What it's looking for:
- Adults extracting personal information
- Secrecy and isolation tactics
- Sexual solicitation or grooming language
- Attempts to move conversations off-platform
- Meeting planning
- Coercion, threats, or manipulation

What it's NOT looking for:
- Your conversations with friends
- Your political views
- Your internet use
- Your personal life unrelated to threats

Guardian operates on a "rolling buffer"—it analyzes recent messages and then deletes them from memory. Only if a threat is detected does it create sealed evidence (encrypted, accessible only to your parents, auto-deletes in 30 days).

**The privacy architecture:**

I'm going to be honest about the privacy trade-offs here:

**What's private:**
- Normal conversations (not stored or accessed)
- Your browsing and social media (not monitored)
- Your location and activities (not tracked)
- Your thoughts, beliefs, identity (not analyzed)

**What's not private:**
- If an adult uses predatory tactics against you, that interaction is flagged
- Your parents can access sealed evidence (not the school)
- Summary alerts go to the school counselor (not teachers, admin, or other students)

**Is this surveillance?**

That's a legitimate question. Here's my answer: surveillance is systematic monitoring of people for control purposes. Guardian is threat detection for safety purposes. There's a difference.

Could Guardian be misused for surveillance? Technically possible, which is why there are legal and technical safeguards:
- Open-source detection logic (publicly auditable)
- Charter preventing mission creep
- Privacy-first design
- Parent control, not school control

But you should stay skeptical. Demand accountability. Question if the system feels like it's crossing lines.

**Your agency:**

You have choices here:
- Your family can opt out if they choose
- You can report concerns directly (don't have to wait for Guardian)
- You can appeal or question a Guardian alert
- You can provide feedback to improve the system

You're not passive subjects of this system—you're stakeholders.

**What happens if Guardian detects a threat:**

1. Counselor receives summary alert
2. Counselor talks with you privately (you're not in trouble)
3. Your parents are notified
4. Evidence is sealed for parent review
5. You, your family, and the counselor decide next steps together

You have a voice in the process.

**The bigger picture:**

Guardian is one tool. It's not perfect. It can't stop every threat. It might make mistakes.

The most important protection is your own awareness:
- Recognize manipulation tactics
- Trust your instincts
- Set boundaries
- Seek support when needed
- Know you're not alone

**Questions?**

(Expect critical questions. Welcome them. Engage honestly.)

**Closing:**

I respect your intelligence enough to be honest with you. This system exists because the threat is real and the stakes are high. But your privacy, agency, and dignity matter too.

If at any point this feels like it's crossing from protection to surveillance, speak up. Question it. Hold us accountable.

You deserve safety. You also deserve respect. We're trying to provide both."

### Q&A for Ages 15-17

**"This feels like a slippery slope toward total surveillance."**

"That's a valid concern. The slope is slippery—which is why there are structural safeguards: Charter preventing scope creep, open-source code, parent control, legal restrictions. But you're right to be wary. Keep watching. Keep questioning."

**"What if I don't trust my parents with evidence access?"**

"That's a real concern for some students. If there are safety issues at home, that changes the calculus. Talk to the counselor confidentially about that—there may be alternative approaches for specific situations."

**"Why should I consent to this?"**

"You shouldn't consent blindly. Consent should be informed. If you understand the system, the trade-offs, and you believe the protection outweighs the privacy cost, consent. If not, talk to your parents about opting out. It's a choice."

**"What stops the school from using this for discipline?"**

"Guardian's Charter legally prohibits use for discipline or surveillance. If that happens, it violates the agreement and parents can demand removal. Also: reputation. If Guardian gets caught doing surveillance, it's done."

**"Can I see my own data?"**

"Your parents can access evidence if threats are detected. You can ask your parents to share that with you. The school can't provide your data directly, but transparency with your family is encouraged."

**"What if someone falsely accuses me through Guardian?"**

"Guardian detects incoming threats to you—not your outgoing behavior. If you're being targeted by someone, that's what gets flagged. You're not being accused; you're being protected."
