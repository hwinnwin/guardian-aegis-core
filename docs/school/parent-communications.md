### Subject: Important Update: New Student Safety Protection at [School Name]

Dear [School Name] Families,

**We're enhancing student online safety with a new protection tool—and we want you to know exactly how it works.**

### What's happening?

[School Name] is implementing **Guardian**, a privacy-first safety system that detects when adults try to harm students online. Think of it as "antivirus software for online predators"—it blocks dangerous behavior before it escalates.

### Why Guardian?

Our students spend significant time online for school, social connection, and learning. While the internet offers incredible opportunities, it also creates risks from adults who target young people for grooming, exploitation, or harm.

Guardian helps us protect students from these external threats while respecting their privacy and normal online activity.

### What Guardian does:

✓ Detects adult predatory behavior patterns (grooming, solicitation, manipulation)
✓ Blocks dangerous interactions in real-time
✓ Alerts our school counselor when threats are detected
✓ Preserves encrypted evidence for parents to review (you control access, not us)
✓ Provides resources and support for families

### What Guardian does NOT do:

✗ Monitor students' normal online conversations
✗ Track location or browsing history
✗ Read messages beyond threat detection
✗ Enable school staff to spy on students
✗ Discipline students for online activity
✗ Share student data with third parties

**Guardian is protection, not surveillance.**

### How it works technically:

Guardian uses pattern-matching and AI to detect manipulation tactics used by predators—things like:
- Adults asking for personal information (address, school location)
- Grooming language ("don't tell your parents," "you're so mature")
- Attempts to move conversations to less monitored platforms
- Sexual solicitation or boundary violations
- Meeting planning or isolation tactics

When these patterns are detected, our school counselor receives a summary alert (not full conversation access). If warranted, we'll contact you so we can work together to keep your child safe.

All evidence is encrypted and only you can access it with a secure PIN. The school cannot read your child's private messages.

### Privacy protections:

- **Local processing**: Most detection happens on-device, not in the cloud
- **Minimal data collection**: Only threat patterns stored, not full conversations
- **Rolling buffer**: Normal messages automatically deleted (not saved)
- **Encrypted evidence**: Sealed and accessible only to parents
- **30-day auto-delete**: Evidence automatically erased after 30 days
- **Transparent**: Open-source detection logic, publicly auditable

### Your role as a parent:

**This is a partnership.** We're not replacing your involvement—we're supporting it.

- You'll be notified if Guardian detects a threat involving your child
- You control access to any sealed evidence (not the school)
- You decide next steps with our guidance and support
- You can opt out if you prefer

### Cost:

**Guardian is free for all families.** No payment required, no hidden fees, no premium tiers. Every student receives the same protection regardless of ability to pay.

(Well-resourced families can contribute voluntarily to support free access for other schools, but this is entirely optional.)

## Template 4: FAQ Document for Parents

**Use when:** Providing detailed information about Guardian
**Send:** With initial introduction letter and ongoing

---

### Guardian FAQ for Parents

**Quick answers to common questions about Guardian at [School Name]**

---

**What is Guardian?**

Guardian is privacy-first safety software that detects when adults try to harm students online. It blocks grooming, solicitation, and predatory behavior in real-time—without monitoring normal student activity.

Think of it as antivirus for online predators.

---

**Why is the school using Guardian?**

To protect students from a real and growing threat: adults who target young people online for exploitation. Guardian helps us detect and stop these threats early, before harm occurs.

---

**Will Guardian spy on my child?**

No. Guardian does NOT:
- Read normal conversations
- Track location
- Monitor browsing history
- Access social media accounts
- Enable school staff to spy on students

Guardian ONLY detects predatory behavior patterns from adults.

---

**What exactly does Guardian detect?**

Guardian detects manipulation tactics used by predators:
- Grooming language and behavior
- Requests for personal information (address, phone, school)
- Sexual solicitation
- "Don't tell your parents" secrecy tactics
- Attempts to move conversations off-platform
- Meeting planning
- Coercive or threatening language

Normal peer conversations, schoolwork, and online activity are NOT detected or monitored.

---

**Who sees the alerts?**

Our designated school counselor receives summary alerts when Guardian detects a threat. They do NOT see full conversations—only a summary of what pattern was detected and why.

Teachers, administrators, and IT staff do NOT receive alerts or have access to student conversations.

---

**Can the school read my child's messages?**

No. The school counselor sees summary alerts only. Full message evidence is encrypted and only you (the parent) can access it with a secure PIN.

The school cannot read your child's private conversations.

---

**How do I access evidence if something is flagged?**

If Guardian detects a threat:
1. School counselor calls you to explain the alert
2. You receive PIN to access Guardian Parent App
3. You log in and review the sealed evidence
4. You decide next steps with school support

Evidence automatically deletes after 30 days to protect your child's privacy.

---

**What if Guardian makes a mistake (false positive)?**

Guardian aims for high accuracy, but no system is perfect. If a benign conversation is flagged:
- School counselor will assess and dismiss if clearly not a threat
- No discipline or consequences for your child
- Feedback sent to improve Guardian's accuracy

Your child is never punished for false positives.

---

**Will my child know Guardian is running?**

Yes. We believe in transparency. Students are informed that Guardian is active and how it works. This is about protection, not secrecy.

Age-appropriate introductions are provided so students understand:
- They're being protected, not monitored
- Normal activity is private
- They can report concerns directly

---

**What happens to the data Guardian collects?**

Guardian collects minimal data:
- Threat patterns detected (not full messages)
- Timestamps and severity scores
- Evidence snapshots (only when threat detected)

Normal conversations are NOT saved—Guardian uses a "rolling buffer" that automatically deletes data from memory.

All data is encrypted. Evidence auto-deletes after 30 days. Nothing is shared with third parties.

---

**Can I opt out?**

Yes. Participation is voluntary. If you prefer your child not to be enrolled, simply indicate that on the consent form or contact the school counselor.

You can also opt out at any time after enrollment with no penalty or questions asked.

---

**How much does Guardian cost?**

Guardian is free for all families. No payment required. No premium tiers. Every student receives identical protection.

(Well-resourced families can voluntarily contribute to support free access for other schools, but this is entirely optional and private.)

---

**Is my child's data sold or shared?**

Never. Guardian will not:
- Sell student data
- Share with advertisers
- Provide to third parties
- Use for anything beyond safety

This is in Guardian's Charter—a legally binding commitment that cannot be changed.

---

**What if I find out my child is being targeted?**

If Guardian detects a threat:
1. School counselor will contact you immediately
2. We'll work together on a safety plan
3. Resources and support will be provided
4. Law enforcement can be involved if appropriate
5. Counseling available for your child

You're not alone—we'll support you through the process.

---

**Can Guardian prevent all online predators?**

No system can guarantee 100% prevention. Guardian significantly reduces risk by detecting known predatory patterns, but determined predators may use tactics that evade detection.

Guardian is one layer of protection—combined with education, communication, and awareness.

---

**What if my child uses their personal phone?**

Guardian can be installed on personal devices (BYOD—Bring Your Own Device) if you choose. This is optional and parent-installed.

School-owned devices have Guardian pre-installed.

---

**Does Guardian work on social media?**

Guardian detects predatory patterns across platforms where installed/enabled. It does not access social media accounts directly—it monitors interactions locally on the device.

---

**Who built Guardian? Can I trust them?**

Guardian is built by [organization name], a mission-driven organization committed to child safety and privacy. Guardian operates under a public Charter that legally binds them to:
