# Guardian Safety Officer Playbook

**Your role: Protect students with compassion, privacy, and professionalism.**

This playbook provides step-by-step guidance for school safety officers (typically school counselors) who receive and respond to Guardian alerts.

---

## Your Role

As the designated Guardian Safety Officer, you are:

**The first responder** for Guardian alerts at your school
**The student advocate** ensuring dignity and privacy
**The parent partner** coordinating safety responses
**The system feedback loop** improving detection accuracy

**You are NOT:**
- A disciplinarian
- A surveillance operator
- A message monitor
- An authority enforcer

**You ARE:**
- A trauma-informed safety professional
- A confidential support resource
- A crisis response coordinator
- A student protection advocate

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Student Safety First
Every decision prioritizes the student's immediate and ongoing wellbeing.

### 2. Privacy Always
You protect student confidentiality except where safety or law requires disclosure.

### 3. Non-Punitive Approach
Students are never disciplined for being targeted by predators.

### 4. Trauma-Informed Practice
All interactions assume potential trauma and center emotional safety.

### 5. Parent Partnership
Parents are primary decision-makers and support providers for their child.

### 6. Professional Boundaries
You coordinate care; you don't replace therapists, investigators, or parents.

## Alert Response Workflow

### Phase 1: Alert Receipt & Initial Assessment

**When alert arrives (email/dashboard notification):**

**Step 1: Log into Guardian dashboard (5 min)**
- Secure login with MFA
- Review alert queue
- Note severity level and timestamp

**Step 2: Read alert summary carefully (10 min)**
- Threat category (e.g., "Adult grooming," "Personal info extraction")
- Severity score (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Pattern indicators matched
- Timeline context (if escalating pattern)
- Student identifier (confidential)

**Step 3: Assess immediate risk (5 min)**

**Critical indicators (act within 1 hour):**
- Imminent meeting planned
- Explicit sexual solicitation
- Threats or coercion
- Active contact with dangerous adult

**High indicators (act same day):**
- Grooming pattern established
- Personal information shared
- Isolation tactics present
- Boundary violations escalating

**Medium indicators (act within 1-2 days):**
- Early warning signs
- Potential boundary testing
- Peer-to-peer concerns
- Educational intervention needed

**Low indicators (monitor/educate):**
- Borderline interactions
- No immediate threat
- Prevention opportunity

**Step 4: Document initial receipt (2 min)**
- Log alert in incident tracking system
- Note time received and initial severity assessment
- Set response timeline

**Total Phase 1 time: ~20 minutes**

---

### Phase 2: Student Safety Check-In

**For Critical/High alerts: Within 1-4 hours**
**For Medium alerts: Within 24-48 hours**

**Step 1: Discreet student contact**
- Pull student from class quietly (avoid peer attention)
- Or schedule "routine" counselor check-in
- Never mention "Guardian alert" in public
- Maintain normal, calm demeanor

**Step 2: Private conversation setup**
- Private office space
- Door closed (or open if student prefers)
- Comfortable seating
- Tissues, water available
- No interruptions

**Step 3: Opening statement (trauma-informed)**

**For students who may not know about Guardian:**
```
"Hi [Name], I wanted to check in with you about something that might be
concerning. I work with a safety system that helps protect students from
adults who might try to hurt them online. It noticed something in a
conversation you had recently that might not have been safe. I want to
make sure you're okay. You're not in trouble—I'm here to help."
```

**For students who know Guardian is active:**
```
"Hi [Name], Guardian flagged a conversation you had recently because it
detected patterns that could mean an adult is trying to harm you. I want
to talk with you to make sure you're safe. You haven't done anything wrong.
I'm here to support you."
```

**Step 4: Gentle inquiry (non-interrogative)**

**Ask open-ended questions:**
- "Can you tell me about this person you've been talking to?"
- "How did you meet them?"
- "Have they asked you to do anything that made you uncomfortable?"
- "Have you told anyone else about this?"

**Watch for indicators:**
- Shame or embarrassment
- Fear or anxiety
- Minimization ("It's not a big deal")
- Loyalty to adult ("They're my friend")
- Confusion about why it's concerning

**Step 5: Assess current safety**

**Key questions:**
- Is contact ongoing?
- Has student shared personal info (address, school, phone)?
- Has student sent images?
- Is meeting planned or has one occurred?
- Does student feel safe at home?
- Are parents aware?

**Step 6: Provide immediate support**

**If student discloses harm:**
- Validate their courage in talking to you
- Reassure them it's not their fault
- Explain next steps clearly
- Assess mandatory reporting requirements

**If student minimizes or denies:**
- Don't push for confession
- Provide education on grooming tactics
- Explain why patterns are concerning
- Keep door open for future conversation

**If student is distressed:**
- Provide emotional support
- Assess for immediate mental health needs
- Offer grounding techniques
- Stay with student until regulated

**Step 7: Document conversation (immediately after)**
- Student's account (in their words)
- Your observations
- Safety assessment
- Next steps planned

**Total Phase 2 time: 30-60 minutes**

---

### Phase 3: Parent Notification

**For Critical/High alerts: Same day as student check-in**
**For Medium alerts: Within 48 hours**

**Step 1: Contact parent/guardian**
- Phone call preferred (not text/email for sensitive info)
- If no answer: Leave message requesting call back (vague: "regarding [student name]'s wellbeing")
- Document contact attempts

**Step 2: Explain alert (summary, not full transcript)**

**Opening script:**
```
"Hi [Parent Name], this is [Your Name], [Student Name]'s school counselor.
I'm calling about a safety concern. Our school uses a system called Guardian
that detects when adults might be trying to harm students online. It flagged
a conversation [Student Name] had recently that shows patterns of potential
grooming or predatory behavior. I've talked with [Student Name] and wanted
to make sure you're aware so we can work together to keep them safe."
```

**Key points to cover:**
- What Guardian detected (pattern type, not full details)
- Your conversation with student
- Current safety status
- Next steps recommendation

**Step 3: Explain evidence access**

```
"Guardian has sealed encrypted evidence that only you can access with a PIN.
This gives you the full context of what was flagged. I can walk you through
how to access that if you'd like. The evidence will automatically delete
after 30 days to protect [Student Name]'s privacy."
```

**Step 4: Coordinate response plan**

**Collaborate with parent on:**
- Immediate safety measures (block contact, device review, etc.)
- Whether to involve law enforcement
- Counseling or support services needed
- School's role in ongoing monitoring

**Step 5: Provide resources**

**Share:**
- Cybertip line (cybertipline.org)
- National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (1-800-THE-LOST)
- Local crisis resources
- School counseling availability

**Step 6: Document notification**
- Date/time of parent contact
- Parent response and concerns
- Agreed-upon action plan
- Follow-up scheduled

**Total Phase 3 time: 30-45 minutes**

---

### Phase 4: Intervention & Follow-Up

**Interventions depend on severity and context:**

**For predatory adult contact:**
- Recommend blocking/reporting contact
- Consider law enforcement involvement
- Provide trauma-informed counseling
- Monitor for ongoing contact attempts

**For peer-to-peer harm:**
- Restorative justice approach (if appropriate)
- Separate interventions with each student
- Parent notification for both students
- School discipline (if applicable, not Guardian-driven)

**For false positive:**
- Dismiss alert in Guardian system
- Provide feedback on why it was FP
- Brief student on why flagged
- No further action needed

**Ongoing monitoring:**
- Check in with student weekly (first month)
- Coordinate with parent on home safety
- Document progress and concerns
- Adjust support as needed

**Case closure criteria:**
- Threat eliminated or mitigated
- Student safety stable
- Parent engaged and informed
- Support services in place (if needed)
- Guardian feedback provided

**Total Phase 4 time: Varies (hours to weeks)**

## Trauma-Informed Communication Scripts

### Opening a Sensitive Conversation

**What to say:**
```
"I'm glad you're here. I want to talk about something that might feel
uncomfortable, but I need you to know you're safe with me and you're
not in any trouble."
```

**What NOT to say:**
- "You need to tell me exactly what happened."
- "Why would you talk to that person?"
- "You should have known better."

### When Student Minimizes

**Student says:** "It's not a big deal. They're just being nice."

**Your response:**
```
"I hear you. It might feel like they're just being friendly. Sometimes
adults who want to hurt kids are really good at seeming nice at first.
That's why I'm concerned. Can we talk about some of the things they've
said or asked you to do?"
```

### When Student is Ashamed

**Student says:** "I'm so stupid. I can't believe I fell for it."

**Your response:**
```
"You are not stupid. Adults who do this are manipulative and practiced
at tricking young people. This is not your fault. You're being really
brave by talking to me about it."
```

### When Student is Loyal to Adult

**Student says:** "They're my friend. They really care about me."

**Your response:**
```
"I can hear that this person made you feel special and cared for. That's
actually one of the tactics predators use—they make you feel like they're
the only one who understands you. A real friend who cares about you wouldn't
[insert concerning behavior]. Let's talk about what healthy friendships
actually look like."
```

### When Student is Angry at You

**Student says:** "Why are you spying on me? This is invasion of privacy!"

**Your response:**
```
"I hear that you're upset, and that makes sense. Guardian isn't spying—it
doesn't read your normal conversations. It only detects when an adult is
using tactics to harm you. Your privacy matters, and so does your safety.
I'm not trying to get you in trouble; I'm trying to make sure you're okay."
```

## Mandatory Reporting Integration

**Guardian alerts do NOT automatically trigger mandatory reporting.**
**You must still assess each situation individually.**

### When to Report

**Report immediately if evidence of:**
- Sexual abuse or exploitation
- Physical abuse
- Severe neglect
- Trafficking indicators

**Guardian alerts may provide supporting evidence but do NOT replace your professional judgment.**

### How Guardian Evidence Supports Reporting

**Guardian can provide:**
- Encrypted evidence preservation
- Timeline of concerning interactions
- Pattern documentation
- Supporting details for investigation

**Guardian does NOT:**
- Make reporting decisions for you
- Provide legal advice
- Replace your assessment
- Mandate specific actions

### Reporting Process

**Step 1:** Assess situation against mandatory reporting criteria (your training)
**Step 2:** Consult school policy and legal requirements
**Step 3:** Make report per protocol
**Step 4:** Document report made
**Step 5:** Notify parent (per policy and legal requirements)
**Step 6:** Preserve Guardian evidence if needed for investigation
**Step 7:** Cooperate with investigators as required

## Evidence Handling

### Accessing Guardian Evidence

**You receive:** Alert summary only (not full evidence)

**Summary includes:**
- Threat category
- Severity score

- Never pressure student to show you messages directly

### Evidence Preservation for Legal Process

**If law enforcement involved:**

Guardian evidence can be preserved beyond 30-day auto-delete via:
1. Legal hold request through Guardian system
2. Law enforcement subpoena/warrant
3. Proper legal process followed

**You do NOT:**
- Provide evidence directly to police without legal process
- Access evidence without authorization
- Share evidence with unauthorized parties

### Privacy Protection

**Always:**
- Access evidence only when necessary for safety
- Limit disclosure to need-to-know basis
- Store notes/documentation securely

**Never:**
- Share student information with unauthorized staff
- Discuss cases in public areas
- Leave documents/screens visible to others
- Use unsecured communication (email, text) for sensitive details

## Managing False Positives

**False positive:** Guardian flags content that is not actually a threat.

**How to identify:**
- Student explanation clarifies benign context
- No concerning pattern upon review
- Obvious misinterpretation of language
- Peer-to-peer appropriate interaction flagged incorrectly

**What to do:**

**Step 1:** Assess thoroughly (don't dismiss too quickly)
- Could this be minimization or denial?
- Is there any legitimate concern?
- Err on side of student safety

**Step 2:** If confirmed FP:
- Dismiss alert in Guardian dashboard
- Provide detailed feedback on why (helps improve detection)
- Brief student on why it was flagged (educational moment)
- Apologize for inconvenience
- No further action needed

**Step 3:** No discipline or negative consequences
- Student NOT punished for false positive
- Privacy maintained
- Trust preserved

**False positive rate goal: <5%**

## FAQ for Safety Officers

**Q: What if I disagree with a Guardian alert?**
A: Trust your professional judgment. If you assess it as false positive, dismiss it and provide feedback. Guardian is a tool to support your work, not replace your expertise.

**Q: Can I access the full conversation history?**
A: No. You receive summaries only. Parents can access full sealed evidence. This protects student privacy.

**Q: What if a parent refuses to take action?**
A: Document their decision. If you believe the child is at risk, consult mandatory reporting requirements and school policy. Your duty to report may supersede parent wishes.

**Q: What if the student begs me not to tell their parents?**
A: Gently explain that you have a duty to keep them safe, which includes involving their parents. Reassure them you'll support them through the conversation. In some cases (abuse at home), consult policy on when parent notification may be delayed.

**Q: How do I know if I should involve law enforcement?**
A: Consult with school administration and follow your training on when police involvement is appropriate. Guardian provides evidence but doesn't dictate law enforcement involvement.

**Q: What if I'm not sure how to assess an alert?**
A: Consult with a colleague, supervisor, or Guardian support team (crisis@lumenguardian.app). You're not expected to have all the answers.

**Q: Can I get burned out doing this work?**
A: Yes. Secondary trauma is real. Prioritize self-care, seek supervision, and set boundaries. It's okay to ask for support.

**Thank you for this critical work.**

You are protecting students while honoring their dignity and privacy.
That's not easy.
But it matters.
