# Lumyn Guardian Aegis Charter

**Version 1.0 — Immutable Governance Framework**

This Charter defines the foundational principles that govern Lumyn Guardian Aegis. These principles are **non-negotiable** and **immune to compromise** regardless of funding pressure, growth, partnerships, or acquisition.

---

## Core Mission

**Protect children from online predators while respecting privacy, dignity, and autonomy.**

Guardian exists solely to detect and prevent human-to-human harm targeting young people. We do not monitor, surveil, or control. We protect.

---

## Immutable Principles

### 1. Protection Before Profit

Guardian's safety mission supersedes all commercial interests. Revenue models, partnerships, and growth strategies must never compromise detection integrity, privacy guarantees, or user safety.

**Non-negotiable:**
- Detection accuracy over engagement metrics
- User safety over data monetization
- Transparency over competitive advantage
- Mission integrity over market expansion

### 2. Zero Surveillance

Guardian is **not** a parental control tool. We detect predator behavior, not normal activity.

**We will NEVER:**
- Read messages beyond threat detection
- Track location
- Monitor screen time
- Spy on academic activity
- Enable authoritarian parenting
- Log keystrokes
- Access cameras or microphones
- Scrape social media for non-safety purposes

**We detect threats only.**

### 3. Privacy is Sacred

All processing defaults to local-first. Cloud inference is opt-in only and privacy-preserving.

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- Rolling buffer operates in RAM only
- Evidence encrypted at rest
- 30-day automatic deletion
- Minimal data collection
- No telemetry without explicit consent
- No third-party data sharing
- Full transparency on what data exists and where

### 4. No Data Selling

Guardian will **never** sell user data, detection logs, behavioral patterns, or any derivative information.

**This includes:**
- Aggregated analytics
- De-identified datasets
- Research partnerships without explicit consent
- Marketing data
- Training data for external models

### 5. Abundance Economics

Guardian operates on a trust-based, abundance model:

**"Get it now. Pay when ready. Even 20 years later. Or never."**

**Implementation:**
- Free forever for all core features
- No paywalls
- No feature tiers based on payment
- No guilt, pressure, or coercion
- Transparent funding model
- Community-supported sustainability

### 6. Transparency Required

All detection logic, model architecture, and crisis protocols must be open to public audit.

**We provide:**
- Open-source detection rules
- Explainable AI decisions
- Public documentation of all algorithms
- Transparent crisis response protocols
- Regular transparency reports
- Community oversight mechanisms

### 7. Open Source

Core detection engine, rule sets, and privacy architecture must remain open source.

**Rationale:**
- Public trust requires public verification
- Security through transparency
- Community contribution and improvement
- Prevention of black-box surveillance

**Proprietary elements limited to:**
- Infrastructure optimizations
- Platform integrations
- UI/UX implementations
- Non-detection operational code

### 8. Founder Veto on Ethics

The founder retains permanent veto power over any decision that violates this Charter, regardless of board composition, investor pressure, or operational structure.

**This veto applies to:**
- Feature additions that enable surveillance
- Partnership agreements that compromise privacy
- Monetization strategies that exploit users
- Policy changes that weaken protections
- Governance changes that dilute mission

### 9. No Venture Capital Capture

Guardian will not accept funding that grants investors:
- Control over product direction
- Veto power over ethical decisions
- Rights to force monetization changes
- Ability to override Charter principles
- Priority over user safety

**Acceptable funding:**
- Mission-aligned grants
- Community crowdfunding
- Abundance-based contributions
- Strategic partnerships with veto-free terms
- Revenue from ethical adjacent services

### 10. Sovereignty Locks

Technical and legal mechanisms must prevent Guardian from being corrupted, co-opted, or captured:

**Technical sovereignty:**
- Decentralized detection logic
- User-controlled data
- Open-source verification
- Community fork-ability

**Legal sovereignty:**
- Charter embedded in governance documents
- Mission-lock provisions in bylaws
- Founder ethics veto in perpetuity
- Public benefit corporation status (or equivalent)

## Detection Principles

### Multi-Layer Architecture

3. **Layer-2 Cloud AI**: Opt-in, privacy-preserving ~1-3s
4. **Community Reports**: Verified human review

### Tiered Response

- **High**: Block, notify parent, seal evidence
- **Critical**: Immediate intervention, preserve evidence, escalate

### Privacy-First Processing
