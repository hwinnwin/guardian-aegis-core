# 🛡️ Guardian Protection

**An open-source, AI-powered child protection system that detects online predators.**

---

## Mission

Guardian exists to protect **ALL children** from online predators—not just those whose parents can afford premium services.

We believe child safety is a fundamental right, not a luxury. This project is:
- ✅ **Free forever** 
- ✅ **Open source**
- ✅ **Community-driven**
- ✅ **Powered by abundance economics**

---

## Architecture

Guardian is a TypeScript monorepo built with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo:

```
guardian-protection/
├── packages/
│   ├── buffer/      ✅ Phase 1: Rolling buffer system (COMPLETE)
│   ├── detector/    🚧 Phase 2: Threat detection engine
│   ├── extension/   🚧 Phase 3: Browser extension
│   └── dashboard/   🚧 Phase 4: Parent dashboard
```

---

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### @guardian/buffer

A high-performance, memory-efficient rolling buffer system that:
- Captures the last 10 seconds of online interactions
- Freezes buffer state when threats are detected
- Provides instant snapshots for investigation
- Optimized for speed: push operations <10ns, capture <1ms
- Zero memory leaks, minimal allocations

**Key Components:**
- `CircularBuffer<T>`: Generic O(1) circular buffer implementation
- `RollingBuffer`: Time-windowed buffer with auto-cleanup and snapshot freezing
- Full test suite with 100% coverage

## Performance Benchmarks

The buffer system is optimized for production use:

| Operation | Target | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Push interaction | <10ns | ✅ |
| Capture snapshot | <1ms | ✅ |
| Memory per interaction | ~500 bytes | ✅ |
| Auto-cleanup overhead | <100µs | ✅ |

---

## Security & Privacy

Guardian is designed with privacy as a core principle:
- All processing happens locally (Phase 2+)
- Only flagged content is sent for cloud analysis
- Parents control all data retention
- No third-party tracking
- Open source for full transparency
